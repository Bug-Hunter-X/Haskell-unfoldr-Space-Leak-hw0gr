This code suffers from a space leak because of the `unfoldr` function.  The `unfoldr` function, while powerful, can easily create space leaks if not used carefully. In this specific example, each recursive call to `unfoldr` adds a new thunk to the heap, representing the unevaluated portion of the list. If the list becomes very large, this can lead to excessive memory consumption, even if the list elements themselves are small.
