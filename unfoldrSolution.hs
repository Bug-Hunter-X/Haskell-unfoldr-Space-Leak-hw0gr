The solution involves using a more memory-efficient approach, such as `foldr` or `build`, that avoids building up unnecessary thunks.  `build` is particularly effective for producing large lists because it forces evaluation in a controlled manner.  Here's an improved version:

```haskell
import Data.List (unfoldr, build)

-- Improved version using 'build'
buildLargeList :: Int -> [Int]
buildLargeList n = build $ \c -> if n <= 0 then c [] else c (n : buildLargeList (n - 1))

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let largeList = buildLargeList 1000000  --Try a large number
  print (length largeList) 
  --Perform further operations on 'largeList' if needed
```
This approach forces evaluation in a controlled way during the list creation, preventing the accumulation of unevaluated thunks and significantly reducing memory consumption.
